        <div class="container2">
            <p><b>Sustainable agriculture</b> is an ecologically and socially responsible approach to farming that focuses on preserving natural resources and promoting long-term agricultural viability. It emphasizes practices that maintain soil health, conserve water, and protect biodiversity while ensuring economic profitability for farmers. By employing techniques such as crop rotation, organic farming, and integrated pest management, sustainable agriculture minimizes environmental impact, reduces reliance on chemical inputs, and supports resilient and diverse ecosystems. Additionally, it promotes social equity by fostering fair labor practices, supporting local communities, and encouraging active engagement among farmers. Sustainable agriculture serves as a crucial framework for meeting current food needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own, creating a balanced and sustainable future for agriculture.</p>

                    <p><b>Crop rotation</b> and diversity are cornerstones of sustainable agriculture, fostering soil health and productivity in environmentally friendly ways.<br>By regularly changing the types of crops grown in specific fields, farmers prevent soil degradation and depletion of essential nutrients. Additionally, diverse crops disrupt pest and disease cycles, reducing the need for chemical pesticides and promoting natural pest control.<br>This practice also enhances soil structure, making it more resistant to erosion and improving water retention.<br>Moreover, diverse crops contribute to biodiversity, attracting beneficial insects and supporting ecosystem health. By embracing crop rotation and diversity, farmers ensure long-term sustainability, higher yields, and a healthier environment, aligning agricultural practices with ecological balance.</p>
