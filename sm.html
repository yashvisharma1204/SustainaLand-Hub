        <p>Land resources encompass the vast array of natural elements found on the Earth's surface, each with distinct qualities and utilities crucial to human societies and ecosystems. This includes the fertile soil nurturing diverse crops, sustaining agricultural practices that feed communities. Rivers, lakes, and groundwater reservoirs constitute vital water resources, essential for drinking, irrigation, and supporting aquatic life. Forests, with their rich biodiversity, provide habitat for wildlife, wood for construction, and act as lungs for the planet, absorbing carbon dioxide. Beneath the Earth's surface lie valuable minerals, from fossil fuels to precious metals, fueling industries and economies. Land also accommodates urban spaces, hosting homes, businesses, and infrastructure, shaping the modern world. Wetlands, deserts, pastures, and cultural sites further enrich our understanding of the Earth's diverse landscapes. Preserving and sustainably managing these land resources are imperative, ensuring environmental balance, supporting livelihoods, and fostering a harmonious coexistence between humanity and nature.</p>

            <p class="item1"><b style="font-size: 40px;">Soil</b><br> The top layer of the Earth's surface that supports plant growth. Different types of soil have varying fertility levels and are suitable for different crops.</p>
            <p><b>Soil Profile</b><br>A soil profile is a vertical cross-section of the soil, displaying the various layers, or horizons, that make up the soil. Each layer has distinct characteristics, including color, texture, composition, and structure, offering insights into the soil's formation, fertility, and ability to support plant life. The soil profile typically consists of several horizons:</p>
            <img src="soil.jpg" style="box-shadow: 10px 10px 10px rgb(176, 176, 176);" >
            <p style="background-color:rgba(11,88,11,0.3); border-radius: 20px;"><b>a. <u>O Horizon (Organic Layer)</u></b>: The topmost layer primarily composed of organic matter such as decomposed leaves and plant material. This layer is rich in nutrients and supports the growth of vegetation.<br>
                <b>b. <u>A Horizon (Topsoil):</b></u> Beneath the O horizon lies the topsoil, which is a crucial layer for plant growth. It contains a mix of organic material and mineral particles. Topsoil is dark in color due to its high organic content and is rich in nutrients, making it ideal for agriculture and gardening.<br>
                <b>c. <u>E Horizon (Eluviation Layer)</u></b>: Also known as the leaching layer, this horizon is characterized by the removal or leaching of minerals and nutrients due to water percolation. It often appears lighter in color than the layers above and below it.<br>
                <b>d. <u>B Horizon (Subsoil)</u>:</b> The subsoil contains minerals and nutrients leached from the upper layers. This horizon accumulates minerals like iron, aluminum, and clay, giving it a different texture and color compared to the topsoil.<br>
                <b>e. <u>C Horizon (Parent Material)</u>:</b> Comprising partially disintegrated or weathered rock, this layer serves as the source of mineral elements for the upper horizons. The C horizon directly influences the soil's composition and properties.<br>
                <b>f. <u>R Horizon (Bedrock)</u>:</b> The unweathered rock layer at the bottom of the soil profile. Plant roots cannot penetrate this layer, as it is solid rock.</p>

            <p class="item1"><b style="font-size: 30px;">Soil Erosion</b><br>The literal meaning of <b>'soil erosion'</b> is wearing away of soil. Soil ero- 
                sion is defined as the movement of soil components, especially surface- 
                litter and top soil from one place to another. Soil erosion results in the 
                loss of fertility because it is the top soil layer which is fertile. If we look 
                at the world situation, we find that one third of the world's cropland is 
                getting eroded. Two thirds of the seriously degraded lands lie in Asia 
                and Africa.<br>

                <b>Soil erosion is basically of two types based upon the cause of 
                    erosion</b>:<br><br>
                  <b style="font-style: italic;"> a. Normal erosion or geologic erosion:</b> <br>caused by the gradual removal of top soil by natural processes which bring an equilibrium between physical, biological and hydrological activities and maintain a natural balance between erosion and renewal.<br> 
                  <b style="font-style: italic;"> b. Accelerated erosion: </b> <br>This is mainly caused by anthropogenic 
                  (man-made) activities and the rate of erosion is much faster than the 
                  rate of formation of soil. Overgrazing, deforestation and mining are 
                  some important activities causing accelerated erosion.

            <p class="item1"><b>Climate Agents</b><br>Water and wind are the climatic agents of 
                soil erosion. Water affects soil erosion in the form of torrential rains, 
                rapid flow of water along slopes, run-off, wave action and melting and 
                movement of snow. </p>

                    of soil from a large surface area, it is called sheet erosion. This 
                    is usually due to run-off water. </li>

                        <b><i>Stream bank erosion:</i></b> During the rainy season, when fast run- 
ning streams take a turn in some other direction, they cut the 
soil and make caves in the banks.

                    of stormy wind and the soil particles of 1-1.5 mm diameter

            <p class="item1"><b>Biotic agent</b><br>Excessive grazing, mining and deforestation 
                are the major biotic agents responsible for soil erosion. Due to these 
                processes the top soil is disturbed or rendered devoid of vegetation cover. 
                So the land is directly exposed to the action of various physical forces 
                facilitating erosion. Overgrazing accounts for 35% of the world's soil erosion while deforestation is responsible for 30% of the earth's 
                seriously eroded lands. Unsustainable methods of farming cause 28% 
                of soil erosion.<br> 
                Deforestation without reforestation, overgrazing by cattle, surface mining without land reclamation, irrigation techniques that lead 
                to salt build-up, water-logged soil, farming on land with unsuitable 
                terrain, soil compaction by agricultural machinery, action of cattle trarn 
                pling etc make the top soil vulnerable to erosion. </p>

            <li><b><i>Conservational till farming:</i></b> In traditional method the land is 
                ploughed and the soil IS broken up and smoothed to make a planting 
                surface. However, this disturbs the soil and makes it susceptible to erosion when fallow (i.e. without crop cover). Conservational till farm- 
                ing, popularly known as no-till-farming causes minimum disturbance 
                to the top soil. Here special tillers break up and loosen the subsurface 
                soil without turning over the topsoil. The tilling machines make slits in 
                the unploughed soil and inject seeds, fertilizers, herbicides and a little 
                water m the slit, so that the seed germinates and the crop grows successfully without competition with weeds. </li>

            <li><b><i>Contour farming:</i></b> n gentle slopes, crops are grown in rows 
                across, rather than up and down, a practice known as contour farming. 
                Each row planted horizontally along the slope of the land acts as a 
                small dam to help hold soil and slow down loss of soil through run-off 
                water.</li>

            <li><b><i>Terracing:</i></b> It is used on still steeper slopes are converted into 
                a series of broad terraces which run across the contour. Terracing retains 
                water for crops at all levels and cuts down soil erosion by controlling 
                run off. In high rainfall areas, ditches are also provided behind the 
                terrace to permit adequate drainage.</li>
